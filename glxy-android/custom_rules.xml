        <!-- We copy over the gdx.jar to the Android project's libs directory
                         because all attempts to reference to JARs in external directories
                         were unsuccessful. This isn't quite as pretty but it works!
                         Ignoring the copied JAR in version control removes problems with
                         duplication. -->
